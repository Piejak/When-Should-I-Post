# When-Should-I-Post
This is a web app that shows users a graph of their likes in relation to the time that the picture was posted. This will allow users to determine the prime posting time in order to maximize the number of likes they receive.

I plan on adding more information about the user's profile such as a graph of your likes trend, meaning how your likes have been increasing or decreasing lately.
